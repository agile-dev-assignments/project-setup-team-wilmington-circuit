# Alberta

### What and why?
Alberta is a much needed overhaul to NYU's Albert. NYU students have long been frustrated by Albert's sluggish, buggy, and convoluted interface. This project seeks to amend these concerns by providing a modern and intelligently designed front end and back end.

### For whom?
NYU students and faculty.

### How?
Alberta will reimplement many of the features found on Albert with a focus on improving user interaction. For example, Albert's course searching system is slow and poorly formatted, and in dire need of an overhaul. Users already familiar with Albert should have little or no difficulty transitioning to Alberta.

## History
The course registration system on NYU Albert has frustrated students for years. The demand for a more intuitive and user-friendly system to register for classes has never been higher, and our goal is to fill that demand.
