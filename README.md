# Alberta

### What and why?
Alberta is a much needed overhaul to NYU's Albert. NYU students have long been frustrated by Albert's sluggish, buggy, and convoluted interface. This project seeks to amend these concerns by providing a modern and intelligently designed front end and back end.

### For whom?
NYU students and faculty.

### How?
Alberta will reimplement many of the features found on Albert with a focus on improving user interaction. For example, Albert's course searching system is slow and poorly formatted, and in dire need of an overhaul. Users already familiar with Albert should have little or no difficulty transitioning to Alberta.

### Product Vision Statement
Alberta will reimplement the most used features of Albert so that students can use Alberta as an alternative. Alberta will provide a much more friendly and elegant user experience for completing these tasks. 

Our goal is NOT to completely replace Albert or the NYU SIS functionality, as such a project would be massive in scope and require major refactoring. Instead, we will use the current SIS system to provide more user-friendly experiences for the most common tasks that are done through SIS, such as class registration, checking schedules and grades, and viewing/editing user info. Some apsects of Albert which are not commonly used will not be recreated, as this is not a full replecement of Albert. However, we are open to having Alberta become an official NYU solution to these specific tasks. 

Additionally, Alberta will implement helpful quality-of-life features that are not present in the current Albert solutions. For instance, having a calendar-view of the potential class schedule before enrolling for a class or multiple classes, to see if and how the classes would fit with each other.

### Minimum Viable Product
At minimum, our product must have intuitive solutions for class registration and viewing class schedules, as this is the most frequest use of Albert among NYU students. 

Our MVP should have: 
- Viewing course catalogs with intuitive filters
- Functional class enrollment system
- Viewing NYU SIS user profile, potentially with support for editing
- Easy-to-read weekly calendar schedule view for enrolled and potential classes.

## History
The course registration system on NYU Albert has frustrated students for years. The demand for a more intuitive and user-friendly system to register for classes has never been higher, and our goal is to fill that demand.
